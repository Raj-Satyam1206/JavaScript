/* UNDEFINED: 
- Undefined is a primitive data type in javascript.
- It means that a variable is declared but not assigned a value.

- Before the code is executed, variables and functions are allocated memory in the execution context. 
- The variables are allocated the value undefined.
- After a value is assigned to the variable, undefined changes to the value assigned.

- Undefined is like a placeholder given to the variable which stays with it until a value is assigned to the varibale.

- UNDEFINED TAKES MEMORY SPACE.

- So, the first console statement will print undefined.



    NOT DEFINED:
- Not Defined means when the variable is used without first declaring the variable.('x')

- In the execution context, memory is not allocate dto these variables.

/*  JS is a dynamically-typed language.
- It means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time.
- The data type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.
