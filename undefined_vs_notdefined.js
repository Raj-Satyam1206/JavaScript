/* UNDEFINED: 
- Undefined is a primitive data type in javascript.
- It means that a variable is declared but not assigned a value.

- Before the code is executed, variables and functions are allocated memory in the execution context. 
- The variables are allocated the value undefined.
- After a value is assigned to the variable, undefined changes to the value assigned.

- So, the first console statement will print undefined.
